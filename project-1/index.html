            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classicalbr
                <br>
                Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                <br>
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                <br>
                Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                <br>
                undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et <br>
                Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
                <br>
                theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
                <br>
                sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
